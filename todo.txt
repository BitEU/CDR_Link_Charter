    Shake up how we visualize the data entirely. Rather than a network diagram like this, turn it into a dataflow diagram. I still want people objects and to move things around and filtering and everything, just change how this is visualized
    I want to be able to click and drag around objects
    I have some suggestions for what you can do to improve performance. Some you may have done already, but do what you havent
        GPU ACCELERATION:
            CuPy support for NVIDIA GPU acceleration
            PyTorch CUDA as fallback option
            Vectorized operations using NumPy/CuPy for massive datasets
            Adjacency matrices instead of slow NetworkX operations âš¡ CPU OPTIMIZATION:
            Multi-threading with ThreadPoolExecutor using all CPU cores
            Vectorized plotting
                single matplotlib calls instead of loops
            Asynchronous processing
                UI stays responsive
            High process priority setting
            Optimized matplotlib backend and rendering settings ðŸŽ¯ SMART PERFORMANCE FEATURES:
            Throttled rendering
                Max 20 FPS during dragging
            Minimal redraws
                Only update when necessary
            Rasterization for complex elements ðŸ“Š PERFORMANCE MONITORING:
            Real-time performance indicators in the UI
            Render time tracking
            GPU/CPU usage display
            Node/edge count monitoring
    The window to manage persons should always stay on top until the user closes it, and you should only be able to open one at a time, I shouldn't be able to have 20 open
    In the PDF export, you should be able to highlight any text in the chart
    I also want the chart in the PDF to be way higher DPI. It should also be in landscape not portrait orientation
